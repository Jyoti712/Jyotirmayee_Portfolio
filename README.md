This is my personal portfolio website, built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing my journey as a Computer Science and Mathematics undergraduate at Christ University, Bengaluru. It highlights my academic background, technical skills, projects, and leadership experiences, with a focus on bridging theoretical concepts and real-world applications.

The site includes an engaging homepage, a detailed “About Me” section, and a project gallery featuring work like a hostel management system, a mobile gifting app, and a weather application. Designed with responsiveness and interactivity in mind, the portfolio reflects my passion for problem-solving, collaboration, and continuous learning.
